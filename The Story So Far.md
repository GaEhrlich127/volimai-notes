[[Qomic]], [[Oogway]], [[Tertloc]], [[Ragnir]], and [[Zarag]] meet at a crossroads nearby [[Turinum]].

### Turinum
Some shit happens, there's some orange animals, we recover [[The Eye of Arborea]], which was stolen by [Beiro Nainodel](<Cult of the Imprisoned#Beiro Nainodel>), [[Ragnir]] leaves the party, and [[Eekee]] joins. [[Qix Nishiiri]] tells us to keep it, and not take [The Eye](<The Eye of Arborea>) to [[The Feywild]]. [[Eekee]] kills some members of [[The Sons of Fire]]. [[Zarag]] finds a vase that he needs to bring to [[Bambaladd]]. 

### Gietberg
Following [Beiro](<Cult of the Imprisoned#Beiro Nainodel>)'s Letter, The Party went to [[Gietberg]]. We're summoned by [[Qix Nishiiri]], and she asks us to kill a Hag in exchange for information, including the identity of [Askann Moonpetal](<Cult of the Imprisoned#Askann Moonpetal>). We do some things, [[Eekee]] gets bullied by some orphans, visit the [Helder House](<Gietberg#Helder House>). [the guy wants his boy](<Cult of the Imprisoned#Gietberg Architect>). The Party entered the [[Gietberg]] branch of the [[Cult of The Imprisoned]], and eventually fight and kill [Askann Moonpetal](<Cult of the Imprisoned#Askann Moonpetal>) and [Raili](<Cult of the Imprisoned#Raili>) write a lengthy message on the wall using their blood, enjoyed a [Wedding](<Gietberg#Lesbian Dwarven Wedding>).

### Bakel and The Fire Plane
The gang heads  to the [[Fire Plane]] to meet [[Bambaladd]], stopping at [[Bakel]], taken by the Officiant of the [Wedding](<Gietberg#Lesbian Dwarven Wedding>). Our first step was meeting [[Rampa]], then killed two Red Dragon Wyrmlings, and ventured to [Bambaladd's Palace](<Fire Plane#Bambaladd's Palace>). [Kaz](<Cult of the Imprisoned#Kaz>) attacks us. [[Zarag]] has a bunch of freaky-deaky dream shit, and gets [Churro](<Zarag#Churro>). [[Bambaladd]] spits us back out at [[Bakel]], per our request.

### Bakel and Bengelo
Returning to [[Bakel]], it's under attack from a Hill Giant. We fight, throw a barrel of Alcohol that had been in The Fire Plane, then blow it up with Firebolt and briefly invent guns. Off to [[Bengelo]] we go. [[Qomic]] steals [Sendris'](<Bengelo#Sendris>) Ring of Swimming. [[Tertloc]] encounters people who know about [his cult](<Cult of the Iron Hand>), and also a scroll salesman and learns the idea. [[Eekee]] meets the clerics of Null, begins the trials, and [[Qomic]] fucking dies.

### Time Skip
[[Eekee]] chooses to stay in [[Bengelo]]. [[Zarag]] and [[Tertloc]] start a scroll business.

### The Golden Hunt
[[Brellim Gendranos]] put on a manhunt event in the [The Scarlet Forest](<Aramoor#The Scarlet Forest>). [[Zarag]] and [[Tertloc]] choose to attend, [[Aegwynn]] is invited, and [[Skr'bakk]] shows up while on the run from [[The Land Pirates]]. The four are placed into a party together and tasked to be the first the retrieve a construct, [Kali Skyro](<Brellim Gendranos#Kali Skyro>), a fugitive from [Gendranos](<Brellim Gendranos>). During the hunt, the Scary Ink Monster attempts to drag us away, but is stopped by a self-aware Illusory Red Dragon. [[The Land Pirates]] show up and attempt to kill [[Skr'bakk]]. The Gang finds Kali, traps her, and creates [[The Log Gambit]] Upon criticizing [Gendranos](<Brellim Gendranos>) for slavery, he dunks on us and puts us in jail on a boat.

### Booooooooooooat
The Party wakes up in jail on a boat. Other jail members consist of: 
* Two dwarves that were dead of Alcohol Poisoning
* Tymis (soon to be Tip of the Spear)
* [Jordan](Acting%20Captain%20Jordan.md Captain Jordan>) the Werewolf (soon to be Tip of the Trident, not yet Acting Captain)
* A guy who's a Weretiger
* [Kaz](<Cult of the Imprisoned#Kaz>)
The gang stages a prison escape, Tymis is designated Tip of the Spear to lead the charge through the singular door into a room heavily defended by Guard Drakes, promptly getting downed. [[Tertloc]] does a sick fireball that hits like 10 guys, but also kills Tymis. **RIP to a legend.** We get to the top of the boat, negotiate with the Captain of the Boat (who is an Oni), he flew away, but while he was flying we shot him down and he fell into the Ocean, presumably dying. The Boat is being helmed by [[The Navigator]], who will not change the course of the boat, which we learn is set for [[Trivanale]], although we learn that we can negotiate with the Navigator at Dawn and he will take us elsewhere. We exchange information with The Navigator.

### Trivanale
We arrive at [[Trivanale]] and somehow bail being captured as soon as the ship docks. The Party heads to [the Governor's Mansion](<Trivanale#Governer's Mansion>) in an attempt to take refuge until Dawn. They offer refuge in exchange for clearing one of the rooms to make the Mansion safer. The room we needed to clear harbored a Spirit Naga that was guarding another door and warned us to not open that door. We kill the Naga, [[Skr'bakk]] takes its head and stores it within his Portable Hole, and then we open the door it was guarding.

### Oops.
We enter a circular room with a large Glaive embedded in a rock. There's a bubble of shadow that moves around as we approach it, which we break by essentially pinching it with two of us and a wall. It reveals [[Raja]], at a limited functionality. He's barely able to speak and move, until he looks into the Glaive and restores himself. He asks about who the king is, and vaguely explains he wants good leadership. As we leave [[Aegwynn]] looks into the Glaive, (against Raja's advice) and begins to buffer.

### Leaving Trivanale
In the morning, we speak to [Moric](<Trivanale#Moric>), who thanks us for our work (and does not know who Raja is), and leave [[Aegwynn]] in the care of [Mork](<Trivanale#Mork>) and we return to the boat. The boat is heavily guarded, and [[Raja]] absolutely fucking solos them all. [[Mearg]] is talking to [[The Navigator]] and watching in horror. He chooses to join The Party, and we set sail to [[Bizanga]], the city nearest to the last known place of [[Kerrilesh]].

### Bizanga
